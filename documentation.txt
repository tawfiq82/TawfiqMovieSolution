My solution contains 2 projects. One is TK.Service which has all the necessary functions to meet the requirements. 
Another project MovieTestingSite is to test some of the functions from MovieService.cs.. 
Testing Web project is not a complete web application, it was developed for my own purpose. As the main goal is 
to provide a service so main focus was set on developing TK.Serivce project. It uses MovieLibrary to access the 
third party data source. I have made some assumptions in my solution which are stated below:

1.I preferred using a new Movie Class instead of exposing MovieData from the MovieService.cs. Movie class is 
currently a replica of MovieData.cs except the name of some properties. As the main purpose is to use the
 service in Company websites and if the web application is developed using MVC pattern, this Movie class 
can be used as Model and all the MVC features can be easily applied to Movie.cs (i.e Adding DataAnnotation). 

2.There is a common function for sorting movies by any of the name of the property except “Cast”.

3.For searching, i used a generic expression builder to create the query. OperatorType can be easily extended
 by adding more operator type and add the corresponding Expression Call in SearchExpressionBuilder.cs.

4.In web application there are different approaches for caching.  As i developed TK.Service in such a way 
that it can be used as a standalone dll, i have implemented my own cache mechanism. I used singleton pattern
 to store the movie list in the memory and added some logic for loading the movie list from the third party 
data source. As being singleton pattern it will be shared among multiple threads and i also implement thread 
safe checking.
